This is a resouce/texture pack that simplifies all textures for Minecraft 1.8 - 1.8.9 that removes most useless particles, effects, and some useless block textures (i.e. Grass) in attempt to further optimize the web client EaglerCraft
- My own EaglerCraft Client hosting website can be found here: https://burnedpopcorn.github.io/Client_Select.html
